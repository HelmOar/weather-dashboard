# weather-dashboard

## Description

weather-dashboard is an app that retrieves data from the openweathermap.org API to provide weather forecast for multple global cities. This allows the user to plan any trip accordingly. weather-dashboard runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS to clearly display the aforementioned data when the user inputs the chosen city into the search. The user is then presented with current weather conditions for that city including temperature, humidity and windspeed as well as a despcriptive icon and the city name. In addition there is a five-day forecast which uses a separate API to connect with the data. 
The city, chosen by the user is stored in local storage and then rendered on same page in a searchable button, where the data can be accessed again. 
This weather dashboard app is mobile compatible
